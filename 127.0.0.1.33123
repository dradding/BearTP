Project 2

In this folder you'll find the sample receiver, code for computing and
validating checksums, as well as example sender code.

Quick! What do I have to write?
===============================
Sender.py is the file in which you will implement your reliable sender. You do
not need to modify any other included files to complete this project. 
Sender.py provides all the scaffolding you need to handle the
command line arguments we will use in the grading of your project.

The Receiver
============
Receiver.py is the sample receiver. The version of Receiver.py here is largely
identical to what we will use for grading your projects (what we actually use
may include additional instrumentation to assist in grading, but should not vary
significantly in functionality). Feel free to modify it, but keep in mind that
we will be testing against our own version of the sender, not yours. 
If bugs are found or changes made to the sample receiver, we'll notify you and
post an updated copy.

BasicSender and Friends
=======================
The BasicSender class in BasicSender.py provides a skeleton upon which to build
your reliable sender. It provides the following methods:

    __init__(self,dest,port,filename,debug=False,sackMode=False): Creates a 
        BasicSender. Specify the destination's hostname, the port at which 
        the receiver is listening, and a filenam
